For lbw after umpire Virender Sharma didn't give it out. Horrible review in fact. Impact is umpire's call and it is missing off comfortably. Rayudu down on one leg and looking to heave the slower delivery but missed. Struck on the elbow I think and then onto the body. Kohli checked with a couple of mates and then went for it.

He is turning it on for RCB. That's as comprehensive as it gets. Sets Jadeja up for the cut but the ball fizzes off the pitch and beats the shot to clatter the stumps.

He judges it beautifully and slides to take it with two hands. If there was one fielder, Kohli didn't want the ball to go to, then it must have been Jadeja.

We have seen Indian batsmen get out to the bouncer but trust me, this has to be one of weirdest ways of getting out. Lovely bouncer and Pant was stuck on the crease, probably beaten for both pace and bounce. Fails to drop his wrists in time and it flies high off the glove. It's a dolly for the KKR skipper and suddenly, the visitors are right back in this with the twin strikes. The in-form Pant has to go. He has a wry smile on his face as he walks back. Knows that it looked comical. On second viewing, the ball didn't bounce much at all but Pant wasn't looking at the ball in any case. 'Never take your eyes off the ball', they say.

This was the quicker one from Chawla and it skidded through low, Shaw didn't expect it to keep that low and his wild pull across the line didn't help his cause either. Misses it completely and the woodwork is disturbed. Nevertheless, a top quality innings from the young man. He's made a statement here in the IPL.

Rana tapped the slower delivery towards backward point and took a few steps out, the ever eager Karthik was more than halfway down before being sent back, Duminy was the one who threw the ball and the rest as mentioned above.
